- Points, lines, circles were not getting converted to geometry when input to a "Get Geometry" component
- Improved error messages by forwarding errors from remote solved components

## [0.6.0] - 2021-05-30
### Added
- Path input (optional)
- Enabled input (optional)
- Asynchronous solving. Components can solve without blocking GH user interface. Asynchronous operation mode is optional per component.
- Maximum concurrent request setting to preferences

### Fixed
- Hid some preference controls on Mac that are only meant for Windows
- Component attempts to detect when inputs/outputs on a server have changed and will rebuild itself

## [0.5.0] - 2021-05-18
